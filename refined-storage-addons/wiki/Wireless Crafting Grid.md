With the Wireless Crafting Grid the player can access their items from anywhere.

To activate the Wireless Crafting Grid, the player has to right click the Wireless Crafting Grid on a [[Controller!Refined Storage]]. If you're playing on Refined Storage 1.7.x or higher you can bind the [[#name]] by right clicking on any connected network device.

To use the Wireless Crafting Grid the item needs Forge Energy. You'll have to charge it in a block that charges items from another mod.

After doing all these steps, the Wireless Crafting Grid is still missing a signal from the storage network. Add at least 1 [[Wireless Transmitter!Refined Storage]] to the network to get a basic range of 16 blocks.

If the Wireless Crafting Grid is ready for use, it will light up blue.

Sometimes, the Wireless Crafting Grid doesn't open or stays gray. To enable it make sure that:

- The Wireless Grid is bound to a [[Controller!Refined Storage]]
- There is at least 1 [[Wireless Transmitter!Refined Storage]] connected to the network
- That you are in range of the [[Wireless Transmitter!Refined Storage]]
- The [[Controller!Refined Storage]] block is still in the world on the place where you bound it to
