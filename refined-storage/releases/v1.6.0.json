The disk itself only stores its ID.\r\n- Added /createdisk command which creates a disk based on the disk ID. Turn on advanced tooltips to see the disk ID on a disk item.\r\n- Added config option to configure controller max receive rate.\r\n- Added config option to configure energy capacity of Refined Storage items.\r\n- Added config option to change Reader / Writer channel energy capacity.\r\n- Added a fully charged regular Controller to the creative menu.\r\n- Added a missing config option for Crafter Manager energy usage.\r\n- Added support for Disk Drive / Storage Block storage and capacity to OC integration.\r\n- Added \"Search box mode\" button to the Crafter Manager.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Renamed \"Printed Processors\" to \"Cut Processors\".\r\n- Rewrote autocrafting.\r\n- Rewrote network energy storage.\r\n- The Controller item now shows a durability bar for the energy.\r\n- You can no longer put a Filter in filter slots to gain additional filter slots.\r\n- You can now re-insert Processing Patterns in the Pattern Grid and have the inputs and outputs be completed.\r\n- If an Interface is configured to expose the entire network storage (by configuring no export slots), it will no longer expose the entire RS storage, due to performance issues.\r\n- The Portable Grid no longer exposes a inventory for crossmod interaction, due to performance issues.\r\n- The Crafting Monitor is now resizable and its size can be configured (stretched, small, medium, large).\r\n- The Crafting Monitor now splits its tasks over tabs.\r\n- An empty blacklist now means: accept any item. An empty whitelist now means: don\u0027t accept any item (an empty whitelist USED to mean: accept any item).\r\n- The Importer now skips over empty slots.\r\n- The Exporter now round-robins over every configured item or fluid to export instead of exporting them all at once.\r\n- Updated Russian translation.\r\n- Autocrafting tasks that take longer than 5 seconds to CALCULATE (NOT execute) are automatically stopped to avoid server strain.\r\n- Changed fluid storage progression to be 64k - 256k - 1024k - 4096k.\r\n- Made all IO blocks have a blacklist instead of a whitelist by default.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug where pattern was recipe pattern was creatable when there was no recipe output.\r\n- Fixed a crash when breaking an Ender IO conduit with the Destructor.\r\n- Fixed bug where storage disks in Portable Grids could be moved into themselves.\r\n- Fixed the Crafter crashing when opening it while connected to a Primal Tech Grill or Kiln.\r\n- Fixed bug where Crafting Upgrade on Interface kept too many items in stock.\r\n- Fixed bug where External Storage could only handle 1 fluid inventory per block.\r\n- Fixed shift clicking a created pattern going into Grid inventory.\r\n- Fixed crash when moving a wireless item with the number keys.\r\n- Fixed bug where item storage tracker didn\u0027t save sometimes.\r\n- Fixed bug where External Storage doesn\u0027t detect new inventory when rotating.\r\n- Fixed JEI recipe transferring in Pattern Grid allowing non-processing recipes in processing mode and vice-versa.\r\n- Fixed using Interfaces for minimum stock levels failing when requester is also an Interface.\r\n- Fixed ItemZoom incompatibility in Grid and crafting preview window.\r\n- Fixed shift clicking upgrades into Interface making upgrades go to import slots.\r\n- Fixed duplication glitch with storages.\r\n- Prevent accidental Grid scrollbar click after clicking JEI recipe transfer button.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Removed Regulator mode in the Exporter.\r\n- Removed MCMultiPart integration.\r\n- Removed Project E integration.\r\n- Removed blocking mode in autocrafting.\r\n- Removed the Wrench.\r\n- Removed \"void excess items or fluids\" functionality on storages.\r\n- Removed the Solderer.\r\n- Removed \"compare oredict\" buttons on Exporter, Importer, etc.\r\n- Removed ConnectedTexturesMod integration for fullbright textures, RS now has fullbright textures natively.\r\n- Removed autocrafting with fluids (the bucket filling mechanic). This will be replaced in a later version with native fluid autocrafting, where Crafters can insert fluids to external inventories.",
