The Wireless Transmitter is used to send signals to wireless network items in Refined Storage.

## Range
The default range is 16 blocks, but can be upgraded with [[Range Upgrade|range upgrades]].

### Bigger range
Keep in mind, **you are not limited to 1 Wireless Transmitter**!

You can spread multiple around in your world, each maximally upgraded with [[Range Upgrade|range upgrades]].

Note that every Wireless Transmitter needs to be connected to the network through a [[Cable]] or [[Network Receiver]]. They do not act as redstone repeaters for a network.

## Placing transmitters efficiently
Placing 2 Wireless Transmitters just next to each other will not do that much.

The wireless signal starts from the Wireless Transmitter's position, so, if you place 2 transmitters next to each other you'll only have a net gain of 1 block.

Instead, you have to spread your wireless transmitters around.
