## Core concepts
Refined Storage is a storage mod where you can build a storage network made up of devices. Those devices manipulate your storage.

In this tutorial, you'll craft a [[Disk Drive]]. A [[Disk Drive]] can contain item or fluid storage disks. Those disks will provide your storage network with storage. If you insert or extract an item, it will use the data on your disks.

You'll also craft a [[Grid]]. Through that block, you can modify your storage (which will modify the data on your disks).

Before crafting any of these devices, you'll first craft a [[Controller]], which ties the entire network together.

## A minimal setup

### Step 1: The [[Controller]]
Craft the [[Controller]]. The [[Controller]] is the "core" of your storage network. You'll be connecting all the Refined Storage devices to this block.

The [[Controller]] needs Forge Energy, most mods can generate this.

### Step 2: Storage and accessing your items
Craft a [[Disk Drive]] and a [[1k Storage Disk]] to store your items.

You can craft a higher tier of [[Storage Disk]], but for simplicity sake we're going for a 1k, which can store 1.000 items.

Put the [[1k Storage Disk]] in the [[Disk Drive]] and craft a [[Grid]] to access your items.

Connect those blocks to the [[Controller]] with [[Cable]], but you can also just place them next to each other in any direction.

### Step 3: Viewing your storage
You are now able to insert and extract items in the [[Grid]].

## Disks in block form
You can also use the various [[Storage Block|storage blocks]] instead of [[Storage Disk|disks]].
