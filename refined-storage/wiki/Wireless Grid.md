With the Wireless Grid the player can access their items from anywhere.

To activate the Wireless Grid, the player has to right click the Wireless Grid on a [[Controller]] (if you're playing on Refined Storage 1.7.x or higher you can bind the [[#name]] by right clicking on any connected network device).

To use the Wireless Grid the item needs Forge Energy. You'll have to charge it in a block that charges items from another mod.

After doing all these steps, the Wireless Grid is still missing a signal from the storage network. Add at least 1 [[Wireless Transmitter]] to the network to get a basic range of 16 blocks.

If the Wireless Grid is ready for use, it will light up blue.

Sometimes, the Wireless Grid doesn't open or stays gray. To enable it make sure that:

- The Wireless Grid is bound to a [[Controller]]
- There is at least 1 [[Wireless Transmitter]] connected to the network
- That you are in range of the [[Wireless Transmitter]]
- The [[Controller]] block is still in the world on the place where you bound it to
