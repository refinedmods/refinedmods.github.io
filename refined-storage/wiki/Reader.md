A Reader has the ability to manage Reader / [[Writer]] channels on a network.

The Reader is a block that takes items, fluids, energy and / or a redstone signal. The data will be transmitted to the configured channel and can be read out with a [[Writer]].

The Reader doesn't auto-extract any of the supported types (with an exception to redstone signals). You have to insert it manually.

## Supported types
- Items
- Fluids
- Energy
- Redstone
