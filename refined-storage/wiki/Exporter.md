The Exporter extracts items or fluids from the storage network and inserts it in the inventory or tank in front of it.

Before being able to export anything, the player has to choose the items or fluids to export.

The chosen items can be configured to be NBT or damage sensitive.

The Exporter should face the block it's exporting to in a way that the wanted slot or fluid tank is possible to reach from that side.
