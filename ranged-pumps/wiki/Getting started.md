## Placement

Place the [[Pump|pump]] down, and it'll only work *without* a redstone signal.

## Redstone signal

If you give the [[Pump|pump]] a redstone signal, it will stop working until you disable the redstone signal.

## Energy requirements

By default, the [[Pump|pump]] requires Forge Energy, but can be configured to not use energy in the config.

## Internal tank

The size of the [[Pump|pump's]] internal tank is by default 32 buckets, you can increase or decrease this in the config.

The [[Pump|pump]] will stop running if the internal tank is full.

## Status updates

Right click on the [[Pump|pump]] to know what it is doing and if it is running.

## Scanning and range

It'll start pumping liquids in rectangular spiral shape 1 block under the [[Pump|pump]].

The default range is 64 blocks, that'll mean it scan 64 blocks in any direction, nearest-first.

On a vertical (Y) level, it will scan liquids from the [[Pump|pump]] to bedrock.

## Liquids to stone

The [[Pump|pump]] will also replace any liquids to stone by default. This can be turned off in the config.

## Auto-pushing liquids

The [[Pump|pump]] will auto-push liquids to neighboring tanks. You can also get the liquids out with pipes.

## Chunkloading

The mod doesn't chunkload [[Pump|pumps]].
